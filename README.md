Hello I'm Allan!

You'll find some of my projects here on github that I've been working on as I teach myself frontend development.  

When I began this journey to change careers I didn't know a thing about software engineering or being a programmer.  I have been technical since I was a kid, building my first computer with my dad from scratch, a 486 DX 33Mhz with MS-DOS then Windows 95! The knowledge of managing memory with boot disks and tweeking them to get the best perfomance for each program, and reading schematics to get the correct dip-switch configurations on a sound board ended up seeding my curiosity for technology.  It's been a lengthy detour, but now I'm back and learning to program web apps and loving it.

The most extensive project I've worked on is my personal webpage https://allanbott.com but everyday I'm cramming new things learned into my head.

Currently I'm about to start my search for a job as a Frontend Devloper, but I'd love to work on some collaboration projects, or even just establish some relationships in the Javascript, React software developer community.

If you ended up here, have a look.  I'll always be growing as the potential is endless in this industry.  

Thanks for stopping by.

Allan
