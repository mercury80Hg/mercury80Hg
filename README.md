Hello I'm Allan!

You will find some of my projects I've been working on in their repositories.  

While you're here check out some of my stuff.  My personal website https://allanbott.com is fun to peruse.

New York Times Best Sellers List is simple but cool as well https://mercury80hg.github.io/NYT-Best-Sellers-List/

Currently I'm looking for a position as a Frontend Devloper, but I'd also love to work on some collaboration projects, or even just establish more relationships in the Javascript, React software developer community.

So have a look and get in touch if you like anything you see.  I'll always be growing as the potential is endless in this industry.  

Thanks for stopping by.

Allan
