Hello I'm Allan!

You will find some of the projects I've been working on located in their respective repositories.  

While you're here check out some of my endeavours.  My personal website https://allanbott.com is fun to peruse.

New York Times Best Sellers List is simple but cool as well https://mercury80hg.github.io/NYT-Best-Sellers-List/

Currently I'm looking for a position as a Frontend Developer, but I'd also love to work on some collaboration projects, or even just establish more relationships in the Javascript, React software developer community.

So have a look and get in touch if you like anything you see.  I'll always be growing as the potential is endless in this industry.  

Thanks for stopping by.

Allan
